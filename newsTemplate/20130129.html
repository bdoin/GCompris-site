{% block content %}
<p>I am glad to announce that a small developper team made a clone of some GCompris activities running on iOS (Apple iPhone / iPad). It is named <a href="http://www.applicationiphone.com/appstore/enseignement/592411421/yellow-duck-educational-software/">'Yellow Duck'</a>.</p>

<p>It works like GCompris on Windows, you can dowload it for free and perform an in app purchase to access all the activities.</p>

<p>Of course, as they use the resources in GCompris that are for most under GPL, their software is also released under GPL.</p>
