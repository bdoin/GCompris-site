<p>Hi,<br />
To celebrate the 20 years of GCompris, we are pleased to announce the release of GCompris version 1.0.</p>
<p>This new version contains a new major feature: the addition of the Activity Settings menu with Dataset selection for more than 50 activities, allowing to choose more specifically what can be learned on the activities.

<p>We also added 4 new activities:</p>
<li class="puce">The long awaited Analog Electricity activity which allows us to draw circuits and run their simulation.</li>

<li class="puce">Learn digits and two subactivities to learn additions and subtractions. The aim is to teach these concepts to younger children, with easy computations.</li>

<li class="puce">Baby keyboard where, when a character is typed on the keyboard, we display it on the screen and play the corresponding voice if it exists.</li>

<li class="puce">Gravity, which replaces the old Intro Gravity, explains better the concept and is more realistic.</li><br/>

<p>You can find packages of this new version for GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS on the <a href="https://gcompris.net/downloads{{ suffix }}.html">download page</a>. This update will also be available soon in the Android Play store, the F-Droid repository and the Windows store. For Raspberry Pi, we'll provide an installer soon. Note that the MacOS package is not notarized.</p>
<p>You can check on this page the voices status in your language: <a href="https://gcompris.net/voicestats/">https://gcompris.net/voicestats/</a>. You can help us by providing a nice recording of your voice for all the missing entries in your native language.</p>

<p>On the translation side, we have 22 languages fully supported: Basque, Breton, British English, Catalan, Catalan (Valencian), Chinese Traditional, Dutch, French, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Malayalam, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.</p>

<p>We also have 4 languages partially supported: Belarusian (85%), Brazilian Portuguese (92%), German (89%), Lithuanian (84%), </p>

<p>As said in the previous news, we decided to only ship translations that are at least 80% completed to let the children have a better experience and not half translated software. Unfortunately, we had to drop the translation for: Estonian, Finnish, Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, Galician, Hindi, Macedonian, Norwegian Nynorsk, Russian, Slovak and Chinese Simplified.</p>

<p>If your language is in the partially supported list, or is no more or not yet supported at all, and you want to help, please contact us (support@gcompris.net) and we will give you instructions to get started translating.</p>
<p>Another way to help is to write some posts in your community about GCompris, and don't hesitate to give us some feedback.</p><br/>

<p>Thank you all, <br/>
Timoth√©e & Johnny</p>{% endblock %}
