<p>Our web site was ten years old, a major refresh was more than needed.</p>

<p>This new one is no more based on a CMS engine but is coded in python
with the <a href='http://jinja.pocoo.org/'>jinja2 template engine</a>
and generated statically.</p>

<p>The site is now generated on the fly including the screenshots
pages. Very important, the new site translation is managed through po
files like the GCompris code base making it easier for translators to
localize the web site.</p>
